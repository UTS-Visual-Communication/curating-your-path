			<h2>For This Task</h2>
			<p>This brief aims to be a basic introduction to the web, how the web works and how text and image work online. We will also introduce you to your own web space that you will be able to use throughout your Visual Communication degree. Sometimes you might use this for course work. But you are also free to use this as a play space!</p>

			<p>Over the course of the rest of this semester, you will be working towards bringing the curated narrative of your year's work together into a website. This website will be designed to have your work as its main focus, with a well thought through grid underlying its design and typographic and visual heirachy that emphasis the most important aspects of your work.</p>

			<p>We want to you to consider the typographic detailing (font, colour, size, spacing), the visual hierarchy and the combination of text and image on your web page. As we progress you will also implement a basic grid which will help to define more complex layouts for your pages.</p>

			<p>The webpage you are currenltly looking at is made from a single HTML file, with almost no CSS styling, but as you can see its typograpchic heirachy is well defined. As you will see this is because of the inbuilt heirachy of the HTML heading tags "h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, & h6". The code for this page can be "inspected" using your browsers inspector, or "view source". </p>

			<h2>Session 1—basic HTML, CSS & typographic heirachy</h2>

			<h3>download</h3>
			<a href="session1-code.zip">Download this weeks code files here.</a>

			<p>You will be guided through these files in the studio session.<p>
			<h3>	1.1.1 - 1.1.4 guide you throught the basics of HTML</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1.1.1 is a bareboned HTML file, the aboslute minimum you need for a standards compliant web page</li>
				<li>1.1.2 guides you through the basic tags you will need to know in order to build a basic web page. These tags form the basis of every site you see on the web.</li>
				<li>1.1.3 Is an example of using the 'h' (heading) tags to create heirachy in a basic text.</li>
				<li>1.1.4 Is a template of a page with text that has no tags providing typographic heirachy. Your task is to work with file to add a meaningful heirachy to the text.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>	1.2.1 - 1.2.3 guide you throught the basics of CSS</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1.2.1 looks at how to use CSS to style your text. The outcome is not pretty, but it is a starting place for you to play with CSS</li>
				<li>1.2.2 Looks at using Google web fonts in your pages. You can use the generic web safe fonts (i.e. ariel, times, verdana). But you should also aim to use web fonts. As they are free and accessible we will be using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Web Fonts</a> in class and recommend you stick to them for your assignment (for now!)</li>
				<li>1.2.3 Use this as a basis for creating a webpage for one of your projects you want to include in your folio - keep it simple.</li>
			</ul>


			<h2>Working on Your Design</h2>

      <p>You should use <em>1.2.3-Basic-Layout</em> as a basis for a page to display one of your projects from this year. You can work directly with the code in order to achieve your design. Sometimes however it can be quicker to sketch out on paper what you are imagining it will look like. You can use thumbnail sketches to quickly detail the layout and visual hierarchy of your page.</p>

			<p>Over the next few weeks we will add complexity to you designs</p>

      </ul>

			<h2>For next week</h2>

			<p>Continue to work on your web page that highlights one of your projects, create different versions so you can experiment with both the HTML and CSS. Create versions using different color palletes, different layouts, different fonts, etc. These won't be your final folio pages, but the more you play with the code the better you will come to understand the material qualities of the web. <b>Rememeber to document and reflect on your process</b></p>
