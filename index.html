			<h3>Text and Image II:</h3>
      <h1>Curating Your Path—responsive web folio</h1>
			<h2>For This Task</h2>
			<p>This brief aims to be a basic introduction to the web, how the web works and how text and image work online. We will also introduce you to your own web space that you will be able to use throughout your Visual Communication degree. Sometimes you might use this for course work. But you are also free to use this as a play space!</p>

			<p>Over the course of the rest of this semester, you will be working towards bringing the curated narrative of your year's work together into a website. This website will be designed to have your work as its main focus, with a well thought through grid underlying its design and typographic and visual heirachy that emphasis the most important aspects of your work.</p>

			<p>We want to you to consider the typographic detailing (font, colour, size, spacing), the visual hierarchy and the combination of text and image on your web page. As we progress you will also implement a basic grid which will help to define more complex layouts for your pages.</p>

			<p>The webpage you are currenltly looking at is made from a single HTML file, with almost no CSS styling, but as you can see its typograpchic heirachy is well defined. As you will see this is because of the inbuilt heirachy of the HTML heading tags "h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, & h6". The code for this page is included in the files download so you can look at how it is put together. You can also do this by "inspecting" the page using your browsers inspector. (see the short video on this embedded bellow) </p>

			<h2>Session 1—basic HTML, CSS & typographic heirachy</h2>

			<h3>download</h3>
			<a href="session1-code.zip">Download this weeks code files here.</a>

			<p>You will be guided through these files in the studio session.<p>
			<p>	1.1.1 - 1.1.4 guide you throught the basics of HTML</p>
			<p>	1.2.1 - 1.2.3 guide you throught the basics of CSS</p>

			<p>You can use the generic web safe fonts (i.e. ariel, times, verdana). But you should also aim to use web fonts. As they are free and accessible we will be using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Web Fonts</a> in class and recommend you stick to them for your assignment (for now!)</p>

			<h2>Working on Your Design</h2>

      <p>You can work directly with the code in order to achieve your design. Sometimes however it can be quicker to sketch out on paper what you are imagining it will look like. You can use thumbnail sketches to quickly detail the layout and visual hierarchy of your page.</p>
