          <!-- This content will take up 8/12 (or 2/3) of the container -->
          <p>This week we are bringing your folio together into a responsive layout. You will make each of the separate pages, and in week 11, you will learn to link them all together with a basic front page which collates all of your work together. You can use the template as is, as simply slot your work into place, or you can make changes to push the design further.</p>

          <p>The coloured backgrounds are showing the underlying grid stucture of the page showing columns, while the is showing the rows</p>

          <p><b>To see this page with the grid highlighting <a href="session2.html">click here</a></b></p>

          <p>This row is divided into two columns, 8/12 (or 2/3) of the container (this column) and 4/12 (or 1/3) of the container (the right hand column with the image)</p>

          <p>A row will always be as high as its longest column. We are not going to look at how the underlying CSS creates this responsive grid (this is covered in the Viscom elective "Designing for Interactions: Webmedia"), we will just be looking at how to use the grid from within your HTML</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <!-- This content will take up 4/12 (or 1/3) of the container -->
          <a href="img/page_layout.jpg"><img src="img/page_layout.jpg" alt="diagram of HTML to layout"></a>
          <p>This image is "clickable" and will open full size in a new page. This is a very basic way of doing this using the browser ability to display an image file. Our CSS scales the image to be 100% the width of the column it is in.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- third row has 1 column -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>Now resize the browser and watch what happens. How does the content resize? What happens when you reach mobile width? This webpage is responsive and will show differently over different browser widths. Keep this in mind as you design your pages, and test how it looks at different page widths.</p>
          <p>As you will have guessed, the underlying CSS for this page is based on a 12 column grid and you can use any combination of columns (that add up to 12) in your layout. Some examples are given below and the "session2-code" folder has examples you can use as starting points</p>
