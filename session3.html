          <p>This week you will be finalising your website by adding a landing page with links out to all of your projects. The entire site can be found in this weeks code download. </p>

					<p><b>Remember, depending on how comfortable with the web code you are, you can use this as a direct template (copying in your own content) or completely customising it to make your own look and feel for your site.</b></p>

					<a href="session3-code.zip"><h3>download the code files here.</h3></a>

					<p>This code is heavily commented. If you get stuck, please take take your time and read through the code and comments carfully.</p>

					<p>Your studio leaders will walk you through linking your pages together as well as uploading to the server. You will also find helpful videos and instructions for these tasks below.</p>

          <a href="https://cyberduck.io/"><img src="img/duck.png" alt="cyberduck logo"></a>
          <p>You need to download and install the cyberduck software to upload your work to the server. <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">https://cyberduck.io/</a></p>

          <h3>Uploading your website to the server.</h3>
					<p>Ensure you know where your files are on your computer. We will be uploading all of your website, so it will look something like the image to the right</p>

					<p>You will need an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program to connect to the <code>www.educ.dab.uts.edu.au</code> server. FTP is the standard transfer protocol used to transfer files over the internet, you can use FTP to download files from a server as well as upload files to a server. We use Cyberduck. If you have not already done so, download and install it from the link above</p>

					<p>Below are the instructions on how to connect.</P>

 					<ol>
						<li>open cyberduck</li>
						<li>click on Open Connection</li>
						<li>for server <b>copy and paste</b> in the following adress <code>ftp://www.educ.dab.uts.edu.au/web</code></li>
						<li>For the username and password use your student number and usual UTS password</li>
						<li>Ensure that the dropdown at the top of the dialogue now reads: <br><code>FTP (File Transfer protocol)</code></li>
						<li>Then hit <code>connect</code></li>
						<li>This may take a moment or two, but it will open up a window with a lot of folders in it, look for the one that is your student number and double click it.</li>
						<li>Once it is open, drag all of your webfiles in to upload them. <b>not the main folder, but the content of the folder</b></li>
						<li>  Go to your URL <code>http://www.educ.dab.uts.edu.au/web/123456</code> (replace 123456 with your student number)</li>
					</ol>

					<p>  Remember that when we go to any directory on the internet the first file that is served up by default is index.html, therefore the file that will be sent to your browser via http will be the index.html file you just copied onto the sites server. You can then follow the links on this page to your other pages of your folio</p>

					<p>See the video below for a more visual version of these instructions</p>
